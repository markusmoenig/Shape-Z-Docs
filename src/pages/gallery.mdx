:::info
For best performance, [install the native version](/docs/installation) of **Shape-Z**. While the web version supports multi-threading, it is still significantly slower due to current WebAssembly limitationsâ€”such as the lack of SIMD and less efficient threading. For example, the Lighthouse demo may fail to compile in the browser but compiles in under a second natively on my machine.
