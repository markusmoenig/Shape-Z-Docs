:::info
For best performance, [install the native version](/docs/installation) of **Shape-Z**. While the web version supports multi-threading, it is still significantly slower due to current WebAssembly limitationsâ€”such as the lack of SIMD and less efficient threading. For example, the Lighthouse scene takes 1 secs on my machine locally vs 15 secs in the browser.
