## Acknowledgements

* [Inigo Quilez](https://twitter.com/iquilezles) was my original inspiration for starting with signed distance functions, you can see his amazing work on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com) and his research on his [website](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/index.htm). Most of the SDF formulas used in **Shape-Z** are based on his work.

* [Fabrice Neyret](https://twitter.com/FabriceNEYRET) and his shaders were a great learning resource as well, he was also extremely helpful in answering questions. His research is [here](http://evasion.imag.fr/~Fabrice.Neyret/).

* The Disney BSDF path tracer in **Shape-Z** is based on [GLSL-PathTracer](https://github.com/knightcrawler25/GLSL-PathTracer) from [Asif](https://twitter.com/knightcrawler25).
