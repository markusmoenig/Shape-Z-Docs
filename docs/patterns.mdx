**Patterns** in Shape-Z use the `u`, `v`, `d` coordinates provided by `shapes` and their `segments`. This makes them reusable across different shapes like `Rect` or `Disc`, and ensures they adapt cleanly to varying scale and orientation.

Patterns define repeating structures or logic within a shape’s `volume` block. Each pattern may expose special variables like `hash` for variation between cells.

## Bricks

Creates a staggered brick wall pattern, with support for mortar gaps and rounded corners.

**Parameters:**

- `size: vec2` — Size of one brick in `u`, `v` space. Default: `vec2(1.2, 0.15)`
- `gap: float` — Width of the space between bricks. Default: `0.01`
- `rounding: float` — Rounds the corners of each brick. Default: `0.0`
- `brick {}` — Block executed for each brick
- `cement {}` — Block executed for each mortar (non-brick space)

**Material integration:**

- `hash` — A float between 0.0 and 1.0 unique to each brick, passed to the material system for per-brick color variation.

#### Example

## Modulo

Splits space into a regular grid of `u`/`v` cells and alternates between two outputs.

**Parameters:**

- `size: float` — Size of each repeating cell in `u`, `v`. Default: `0.02`
- `even {}` — Block executed for even tiles
- `odd {}` — Block executed for odd tiles

This is useful for checkerboards, alternating patterns, or dithering effects.

**Material integration:**

- `hash` — A float between 0.0 and 1.0 unique to each cell, passed to the material system for per-cell color variation.
