Shape-Z defines high-level **2D shapes** that can be extruded and subdivided with segments. These are the foundational building blocks for modeling walls, floors, and curved surfaces.

Inside shapes we have two helper variables:  
* `sdf` – the raw signed distance (negative inside, positive outside).  
* `inside` – convenience alias for `-sdf` (positive inside, zero on the surface).

### Rect

A rectangular shape that spans the full domain in its plane. It supports **subsegments** like `Floor`, `Ceiling`, `Left`, `Right`, `Back`, and `Front`, which allow fine-grained control over geometry placement.

- Coordinate system: **Cartesian**
- Axes: `u`, `v`, `d` (e.g., for a Floor segment, `u = x`, `v = z`, `d = y`)
- Typical usage: Rooms, flat walls, layered architecture

#### Example

<ShpzPlayground
    code={`voxel Box size = vec3(3, 2, 3) {
    shape Rect {
        segment Floor depth = 0.2 {
            Metal;
        }
        segment Left depth = 0.2 {
            Metal;
        }
        segment Back depth = 0.2 {
            Metal;
        }
    }
}

place Box at = 0;`}

### Disc

A circular shape with a radial layout. It does **not support subsegments**, but instead provides `u`, `v`, and `d` in **polar coordinates**, ideal for modeling towers, fans, and radial symmetry.

- Coordinate system: **Polar**
- `u`: angle (normalized 0–1)
- `v`: radius (normalized)
- `d`: height
- Typical usage: Cylindrical bases, circular panels, decorative columns

#### Example

<ShpzPlayground
    code={`voxel Box size = 3 {
    shape Disc {
        Metal;
    }
}

place Box at = 0;`}
    height={300}
