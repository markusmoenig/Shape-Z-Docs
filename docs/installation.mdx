# Installation

The easiest way to install **Shape-Z** for all platforms is to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and cargo. To install Rust see the easy instructions at [Rustup](https://rustup.rs).

After installing Rust you can install `shpz` by typing the following command in your terminal:

```shell
cargo install shpz
```

This installs [shpz](https://crates.io/crates/shpz), the compiler and renderer front-end for **Shape-Z**. You can now invoke `shpz` in your terminal.

If you want to update `shpz` to the latest version just enter the above terminal command again.
