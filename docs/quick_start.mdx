# Quick Start Guide

Let's get started with **Shape-Z** by creating a voxel box with the dimensions of 4x4x4 units and placing it at the origin. One unit (or tile) corresponds to a 1x1x1 cube in world space. By default **Shape-Z** uses a **density** of `40`, meaning:
- 1 unit = 40 × 40 × 40 = 64,000 voxels
- A shape of 4x4x4 units becomes 160 × 160 × 160 voxels
- That’s a total of 4,096,000 voxels

You can easily change the density, more on that later.

The `Black` material is one of the 4 default materials of **Shape-Z**. Here, we are simply telling the system to apply the Black material to every voxel inside the box.

**Shape-Z** uses a math syntax similar to **GLSL**, but internally it operates entirely on a single type: `vec3`.  
In the next example, we manually calculate the distance to a sphere at the center of the voxel box.  
While **Shape-Z** offers many built-in tools to simplify tasks like this, it's helpful to understand that you can also write code much like a fragment shader.

The system variable `local` defines the position of each voxel in local space, with the origin at the center of the voxel box.

Now let's get started with some core modeling mechanics. Shapes subdivide space and can further be folded via segments.
